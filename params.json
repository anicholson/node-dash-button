{"name":"Node Dash Button","tagline":"A small module to emit events whe an Amazon Dash Button is pressed","body":"\r\n### Place it. *Hack it.* Press it. ~~Get it.~~\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/PP0CJ3s.png?1)\r\nNode Dash Button is a simple library that will allow you to utilize a dash button to emit an event.  I am using the same strategy of watching for dash generated ARP requests as the article below.\r\n\r\nThis module was inspired by [this fantastic article by Edward Bensen](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8).\r\n#### First Time Dash Setup \r\n\r\nFollow Amazon's instructions to configure your button to send messages when you push them but not actually order anything. When you get a Dash button, Amazon gives you a list of setup instructions to get going. Just follow this list of instructions, but don’t complete the final step (#3 I think) **Do not select a product, just exit the app**.\r\n\r\n#### Find a Dash\r\nTo find a dash on your network, run the following from the node-dash-button directory in node_modules:\r\n``` sh\r\n# you may need to use sudo due to libpcap running in permiscuous mode\r\n$ cd node_modules/node-dash-button\r\n$ node bin/findbutton\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will watch for new arp requests on your network.  There may be several arp requests, so press it a few times to make sure. Copy the hardware address as shown below\r\n\r\n![hw address](http://i.imgur.com/BngokPC.png)\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage:\r\n``` js\r\n//warning this may trigger multiple times for one press\r\n//...usually triggers twice based on testing for each press\r\ndash_button = require('node-dash-button');\r\nvar dash = dash_button(\"8f:3f:20:33:54:44\"); //address from step above\r\ndash.on(\"detected\", function (){\r\n\tconsole.log(\"omg found\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n#### Example Projects:\r\nI collected a few examples I found on github of how people are using this module, some projects are more mature than others\r\n- [PizzaDash](https://github.com/bhberson/pizzadash) uses a node dash to order Domino's pizza. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9407669/amazon-dash-button-hack-pizza), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/an-american-hero-hacked-an-amazon-dash-button-to-order-1733347471) and [Grubstreet](http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/09/amazon-dash-button-dominos-hack.html#)  did short writeups on the PizzaDash project].  \r\n- [dashgong](https://github.com/danboy/dashgong) uses the node dash to send a message to slack\r\n- [dash-listener](https://github.com/dkordik/dash-listener) performs various home automation tasks like adjusting lights and interacting with a music player\r\n- [Nest-Dash](https://github.com/djrausch/Nest-Dash) toggles the Nest setting from away to home via Amazon Dash Button\r\n- [dash-hipchat-doorbell](https://github.com/Sfeinste/dash-hipchat-doorbell) quick and dirty node app that intercepts traffic from an amazon dash button and creates a hipchat notification (think doorbell)\r\n- [netflixandchill](https://github.com/sidho/netflixandchill) button to netflix and chill, dims the lights (no interface with netflix yet)\r\n- [dash-rickroll](https://github.com/girliemac/dash-rickroll/blob/8f0396c7fec871427fe016a2dd5787f07b1402cc/README.md) title explains it all \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor Alex Hortin(@hortinstein)\r\n\r\nContributor Dan Kordik (@dkordik)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
